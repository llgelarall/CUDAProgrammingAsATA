# My Experience as a Teaching Assistant: Communication Guidelines for Students

I am Gelara Jafari Pouyani, a master's student in computer science with a focus on hardware architecture at Shahid Beheshti University. As of June 2024, I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for four semesters. My experience includes working with bachelor’s students in the Logic Gate course and with master’s and Ph.D. students in various courses such as parallel programming, hardware design of DNN accelerators, bio-inspired computing, and more.

Throughout my time as a TA, I have taken on various roles, such as designing theoretical and programming exercises, answering questions during exams, evaluating midterms and finals, assessing students' middle and final projects, addressing their project-related queries, and problem-solving in the classroom.

During these experiences, I faced difficulties with some students that affected me negatively. To help both students and other TAs foster a more professional relationship, I decided to share some important communication guidelines.

## Communication Guidelines for Students

### 1. Ask Direct Questions
Don’t ask, “May I ask a question?” Instead, directly ask your question in one message. This saves time and gets you the information you need faster.

### 2. Respect Your TA’s Availability
Always ask your TA about their preferred times for questions and adhere to that schedule. For example, if they are available on even days from 12 PM to 6 PM, do not ask questions on odd days at 10 AM.

### 3. Be Patient
After asking a question, be patient. You will likely get an answer, but due to their busy schedules, your TA might respond later. Patience is key.

### 4. Do Your Research First
Before asking a question, especially programming-related ones, do some preliminary research. Use Google or ask GPT, and review at least all the search results on the first page. This helps you learn and shows that you respect your TA’s time.

### 5. Express Gratitude
After receiving an answer, always say thank you. If you don’t show appreciation, don’t expect your future questions to be answered.

### 6. Maintain Politeness
Always be polite, regardless of the situation. You do not have the right to use impolite or abusive language. TAs are advised to stand firm against such behavior, inform the student of their misconduct, and then report it to a supervisor if necessary.

### 7. Send Clear Screenshots, Not Photos
Do not send a picture of your screen taken with your phone. If you need to share something on your screen, take a clear screenshot instead. This ensures clarity and helps your TA understand the issue better.

### 8. Ask Specific, Thoughtful Questions About Your Code
Do not send large chunks of code or your entire codebase and ask for revisions. Your questions should be specific and demonstrate that you have attempted to solve the problem yourself. TAs are there to help guide you, not to solve the problem for you.

Following these guidelines will not only help you get better support from your TAs but also build a respectful and productive academic environment.

Feel free to share your thoughts or ask questions about these guidelines. Let's work together to make the learning experience smoother and more enjoyable for everyone!
